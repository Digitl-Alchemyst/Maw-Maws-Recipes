File structure: Recipes stored as markdown files in /recipes/[category]/[recipe-name].md

Technical Requirements

NextJS with TypeScript
Static generation using getStaticProps/getStaticPaths
Responsive design with warm, homey styling (cream, browns, soft oranges)
SEO optimization and accessibility
Interactive features (ingredient checklists, recipe scaling, search/filter)

Content Structure

Markdown files with frontmatter containing: title, category, prep/cook times, servings, difficulty, tags, ingredients, instructions
